<p>AWS provides a set of fully managed services that you can use to build and run serverless applications. Serverless applications donâ€™t require provisioning, maintaining, and administering servers for backend components such as compute, databases, storage, stream processing, message queueing, and more. You also no longer need to worry about ensuring application fault tolerance and availability. Instead, AWS handles all of these capabilities for you. This allows you to focus on product innovation while enjoying faster time-to-market.</p>

		<h3>Design Architecture</h3>
		<p>Serverless applications don't require you to provision, scale, and manage any servers. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.</p>
		<p>We can design a Serverless Architecture for you using the best practices recommended by AWS.</p>
		<h4>Serverless applications have four main benefits.</h4>
			<ul style="padding-left:5%">
				<li>Infrastructure cost reduction</li>
				<li>No server management</li>
				<li>Flexible scaling</li>
				<li>Automated high availabilty</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>PoC & MVP</h3>
		<p>If you are a big company that is willing to move to the cloud, we can develop a small PoC to validate your approach and deploy your idea in a cloud environment.</p>
		<p>Maybe you are a small company that are looking reduce the time-to-market and have limited budget, we can work with you to make a MVP in shortest period of time using the serverless approach.</p>
