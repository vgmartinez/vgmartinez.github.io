		<h3>Design Big Data Architecture</h3>
		<p>Every company is different and each of them consumes data in a very different way, we can design and build a BigData Architecture that can manage huge volumes of data in real time or batch process. There are many services available that can help us make everything possible but we need to combine them in just the right way for a perfect integration.</p>

		<h3>Design a DataLake</h3>
		<p>The most critical part in the Big Data ecosystem is how and where to store data. Before taking an architectural decision it's necessary to know how the data is going to be consumed. Sometimes using columnar formats like Parquet is one of the better options, this is due to the because have a high performace and they are compatible with most of the important tools in the Big Data ecosystem</p>

		<h3>ETL Process</h3>
		<p>Most of the time a lot of data is stored in your on-premises infrastructure and you might want to migrate this data to the cloud for analytical purposes or simply to archive it. If you want to consume this data later through some visualization tool, an ETL process will be necessary, and depending of the complexity and the volume of your data, the process could be very complex.</p>
