		<h3>Design Big Data Architecture</h3>
		<p>Every company is different and with different way of consume their data, we can design and build a BigData Architecture that can manage huge volume of data in real time or batch process. We have many services that can help us to make everything possible but we need to combine them in the right way.</p>

		<h3>Design a DataLake</h3>
		<p>The most critical part in the Big Data ecosystem is how and where store the data. Before take a architectural decision is necessary know how the data is going be consume it. Some time using columnar format like Parquet is the best option because have a hight performace and is compatible with the most important tools in the Big Data ecosystem</p>

		<h3>ETL Process</h3>
		<p>Most of the time you have a lot of data in your on-premises infrastructure and you want to migrate this data to the cloud for make some analytic or for archive it. If you want migrate the data for consume later with some visualization tools is necessary a ETL process that depending of the complexity and the volume of your data the process can be very complex.</p>
