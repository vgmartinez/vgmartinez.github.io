		<h3>Hybrid Architecture</h3>
		<p>For most organizations with on-premises technology investments, operating in a hybrid architecture is a necessary part of cloud adoption and transition. Migrating legacy IT systems takes time, therefore, selecting a cloud provider who can help you implement a thoughtful hybrid strategy, without requiring costly new investments in on-premises hardware and software is important to simplify operations and more easily achieve your business goals.</p>

		<h3>Migrate your data</h3>
		<p>At the most fundamental level, hybrid computing can be viewed as having data that resides both on-premises and in the cloud. This is often done to economically store large data sets, utilize new cloud-native databases, move data closer to customers, or to create a backup and archive solution with cost-effective high availability. In all cases, AWS offers a range of storage and database services that can work together with your on-premises applications to store data reliably and securely. Using these services on AWS can allow you to achieve the same or better control, reliability, and availability that you enjoy in your data centers today with a design for 99.999999999% durability and secure encryption, so that you can feel confident that your data is protected.</p>

		<h3>Migrate your Servers</h3>
		<p>The most robust form of hybrid architecture involves integrating application deployment and management across on-premises and cloud environments.</p>

	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Train your team</h3>
		<p>Your employees need to be trained to manage the cloud infrastructure using the best practices and taking the best decisions. Your solution has to be designed keeping in mind at all times 3 key aspects: Pricing, security and scalability.</p>

	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Help you manage the AWS Account</h3>
		<p>Establishing a single identity and access strategy often goes hand-in-hand with integrating networks. You can create and manage AWS users, groups, and permissions to allow and deny access to AWS resources at an extremely fine level of detail. Additionally, AWS offers managed services that allow you to connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory and manage policies with existing tools.</p>
